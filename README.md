#### Add new readme file
#### Goals:
- Start with multi-layer perceptron, work towards RNN.
- Then finally implement a transformer.
- Use a autoencoder to understand the features of the transformer.
- Ultimately working towards a project that will aid the understanding of LLMs
- Another project idea is to use natural language to pull up videos that match the query
  - This can be useful for searching for film in sports.
